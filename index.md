###Over to you

So, now it's your turn. 

Taking a look at the designers shown above research, thoroughly, a few who particularly inspire you. Look at what they have created, what inspires them and who they have worked for. 

Now list your interests, what inspires you in design, art, music, film, nature, it's up to you.

Great ideas come from solid research, planning and discussion. You will benefit hugely from discussion with your peers and your tutors so make use of them to make sure you are going in the right direction. 

Try to come up with two or three ideas you would like to explore and discuss them with your tutors before narrowing it down to one. This final idea will be the one you will take forward to completion and, through the six week session, present your work to the world through an online platform.
