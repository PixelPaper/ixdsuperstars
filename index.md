###What others have created

The following list of names looks at a range of people and some of the digital products they have created. Some have been born from personal side projects while others have more of a commercial origin.

###Over to you

So, now it's your turn. 

Taking a look at the designers shown above research, thoroughly, a few who particularly inspire you. Look at what they have created, what inspires them and who they have worked for. 

Now list your interests, what inspires you in *design, art, music, film, nature,* it's up to you.

####Research, research, research

Great ideas come from solid research, planning and discussion. You will benefit hugely from discussion with your peers and tutors so make use of them to make sure you are going in the right direction. 

Try to come up with two or three ideas you would like to explore and discuss them with your tutors before narrowing it down to one. This final idea will be the one you will take forward to completion and, through the six week session, present your work to the world through an online platform.

**To keep you on track it would be useful to stick to the following deadlines.**

####Thursday 12 February 2015
Having researched a number of the designers covered during Monday's presentation you should be able to develop two to three possible routes for your personal digital project. 

Talking through these with Paul or Pip you will be in a position by the end of Thursday's session to take your final project forward to the next stage.


####Thursday 19 February 2015
Presentation of final digital project idea. You should aim to present a creative route you see your project taking with a number of visuals (physical or digital) to outline the approach you could take forward to the six week IxD Foundation session.

**What do I need to create?** We would like to see a solid plan on how you would like to take your project further and a series of visuals of what you would intend to produce. These could either be created by hand or produced on the computer and printed off. 

For example, say you're into collecting Barbie dolls and love 8-bit games. Combine those passions and you could end up with a series of Ken and Barbie 8-bit icons or a range of 8-bit Barbie-Through-The-Ages posters. *This is my idea so hands off ;-)* 

So with your 8-bit Barbie project in action we would like to see how you would visualise it by creating a few posters or a series of icons to show off your skills and give us an idea how it could be taken forward to the next stage.

Next steps
----------

OK, now we are moving forward with your initial project ideas I would suggest checking out the following timetable to help you keep on track (don’t panic if this doesn’t fit with your plans but it could help):

####Week 06 (this week)
Review project and revise if necessary. 

####Weeks 07–09 (this will bring you up to Easter)
Develop a series of icons, characters, screens, etc. These would be refined on paper then taken to the computer (if appropriate). I can help with moving things to screen.

*If you are looking at an app design you would be looking at developing a logo, supporting icons and the various screens to keep everything consistent.

So. Say your project was a series of origami-inspired, flat graphic, Star Wars characters. By Easter (or over the holidays if you need more time) you would expect to have around six characters (more if you want) created on computer (PhotoShop, Illustrator, Sketch). 

So by the start of Week 10 you could have an origami-inspired, flat graphic R2D2, C3PO, Darth Vader, Obi Wan Kenobi, Yoda and Boba Fett. Wonderful!

####Week 10
Using your characters, icons, etc you could create a range of posters, postcards, laptop/smartphone backgrounds… the sky’s the limit.

####Week 11
Getting it online, set yourself up with a [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/), [Society 6](http://society6.com), [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/uk) [Behance](https://www.behance.net), [TicTail](https://tictail.com)… account. Getting your work online is the only way to get noticed. 

If you’re not currently on Twitter get yourself a Twitter account and start following [@shealo](https://twitter.com/shealo) [@fehler](https://twitter.com/fehler) [@ElevenThirty](https://twitter.com/eleventhirty) from there we will suggest other people you should be following. Twitter is an excellent vehicle for self promotion.

####Week 12
Tidy up loose ends and relax! You’re finished. party!!!
