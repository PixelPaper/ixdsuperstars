###What others have created

The following list of names looks at a range of people and some of the digital products they have created. Some have been born from personal side projects while others have more of a commercial origin.

###Over to you

So, now it's your turn. 

Taking a look at the designers shown above research, thoroughly, a few who particularly inspire you. Look at what they have created, what inspires them and who they have worked for. 

Now list your interests, what inspires you in *design, art, music, film, nature,* it's up to you.

####Research, research, research

Great ideas come from solid research, planning and discussion. You will benefit hugely from discussion with your peers and tutors so make use of them to make sure you are going in the right direction. 

Try to come up with two or three ideas you would like to explore and discuss them with your tutors before narrowing it down to one. This final idea will be the one you will take forward to completion and, through the six week session, present your work to the world through an online platform.

**To keep you on track it would be useful to stick to the following deadlines.**

####Thursday 12 February 2015
Having researched a number of the designers covered during Monday's presentation you should be able to develop two to three possible routes for your personal digital project. 

Talking through these with Paul or Pip you will be in a position by the end of Thursday's session to take your final project forward to the next stage.


####Thursday 19 February 2015
Presentation of final digital project idea. You should aim to present a creative route you see your project taking with a number of visuals (physical or digital) to outline the approach you could take forward to the six week IxD Foundation session.

**What do I need to create?** We would like to see a solid plan on how you would like to take your project further and a series of visuals of what you would intend to produce. These could either be created by hand or produced on the computer and printed off. 

For example, say you're into collecting Barbie dolls and love 8-bit games. Combine those passions and you could end up with a series of Ken and Barbie 8-bit icons or a range of 8-bit Barbie Through the Ages posters. *This is my idea so hands off ;-)* 

So with your 8-bit Barbie project in action we would like to see how you would visualise it by creating a few posters or a series of icons to show off your skills.
